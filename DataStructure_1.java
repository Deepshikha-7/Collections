/*Data structure:- It is the way by which we can store the data in efficient(Time and space complexity) way
 *
 *Types of data structure:- 
 *There are two types of data structure:
 *1) Primitive data structure:- there are 8 data types eg:- byte, short, boolean, char, int, long, float, double.
 *	 We can use primitive data type to build some programs like:- calculator, snake game, currency converter etc.
 *
 *2) Non-primitive data structure:- In non- primitive data structure there are two types of data structure:
 *	 i) Linear data structure	ii) Non-linear data structure
 *i)Linear data structure:-
 *	->String
 *	->Array
 *	->List
 *	->Set
 *	->Queue
 *	->ArrayList
 *	->LinkedList
 *	->HashSet
 *	->LinkedHashSet
 *	etc.
 *
 *ii)Non-linear data structure:-
 *	->Graph
 *	->Tree
 *We can use non-primitive data structure to build big programs like e-commerce, social networking, banking application etc.
